            From 1991 to 1999, HTML developed from version 1 to version 4.

            In year 2000, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommended XHTML 1.0. The XHTML syntax was strict, and
            the developers were forced to write valid and "well-formed" code.

            In 2004, W3C's decided to close down the development of HTML, in favor of XHTML.

            In 2004, WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) was formed. The WHATWG wanted to
            develop HTML, consistent with how the web was used, while being backward compatible with older versions of
            HTML.

            In 2004 - 2006, the WHATWG gained support by the major browser vendors.

            In 2006, W3C announced that they would support WHATWG.

            In 2008, the first HTML5 public draft was released.
